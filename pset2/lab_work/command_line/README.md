# Linux Command Line
- CS50 IDE is a cloud-based machine running Ubuntu, one of the many flavors of the Linux OS. 
- Many modern linux distributions have graphial user interfaces (GUI) to allow easy mouse-based navigation. 
- Still, as a programmer you'll likely be using terminal window frequently and you can do many of the same tasks with keyboard commands. 

## Linux Commands
Some of the most important keyboard-based commands for working within the IDE or any UNIX-based system:
- `ls`: This command accesses the contents of the current directory.
- `cd`: Short for "change directory", this command changes your directory to **<directory>**, which I can specify on my workspace or operating system. The shorthand name for the parent directory of current directory is **..**.
