#This is an implementation of the mario problem in Python because I was so sick of using C. This problem would have been simple if there was a function to multiple a character print("#"*4) but this doesn't happen in C. 

#This is not part of homework. This is just me feeling good with python after taking an hour solving the mario problem ;(
