/* OPERATORS

C provides a shorthand way to apply arithmetic operator to a single variable */ 
x = x*5; 
x *= 5; // both lines are the same 

// Trick works with all 5 basic arithmetic operators. C also provides a shorthand for incrementing and decrementing a variable by 1:
x++;
x--;

//Two main types of boolean expressions: logical operators and relational operators. 

// Logical Operators (logical comparisons)
// Logical AND (&&) is true if and only if both operands are true, otherwise false. 
// Logical OR (||) is true if and only if at least one operand is true, otherwise false. 
// Logical NOT (!) inverts value of its operand. 

//Relational operators 
// Less than (x<y), great than (x>y) and so on...
// Can also test two variables for equality (x==y) or (x!=y)
